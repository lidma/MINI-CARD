## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

For me it was very dificult to choose the right properties in css to get the body and the .card to work and flexbox properties.

At the end, i believe i did a good job with the things that i used.
Always open to any comments


```css
.flex-container {
        width: 100%;
        display: flex;
        gap: 10px;
        margin: 0 auto;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        
    }

### Continued development

I would like to make more flebox layout to get familiar.

The card could be links to a document or something along those ways. Going to think about something useful that could come in handy.

### Useful resources

- [understanding css](https://www.taniarascia.com/) - This helped me to understand better how to use flexbox.
